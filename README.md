# 🏛️ BlockMatrix-DAO

## 📘 Project Description
**BlockMatrix-DAO** is a decentralized governance system built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It enables members to **create proposals**, **vote**, and **execute decisions** democratically.  
The contract ensures transparent and tamper-proof voting using smart contract logic.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with a **token-based voting** system (using ERC-20 governance tokens).  
- Addition of **time-based proposal deadlines** and quorum requirements.  
- Development of a **frontend DApp** for user-friendly interactions.  
- DAO **treasury management** to handle funds securely via proposals.  
- Implementation of **cross-chain governance support**.
